# FastText
The reason for this interest is that fastText obtains an accuracy in text classification almost as good as the state of the art in deep learning, but it is several orders of magnitude faster.

# Neural Relation Extraction(NRE)

Neural relation extraction aims to extract relations from plain text with neural models, which has been the state-of-the-art methods for relation extraction.
